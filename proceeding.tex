\abstract{This proceeding presents a search for direct and gluino-mediated production of supersymmetric scalar top-quark pairs in the all-hadronic final state using top tagging. The result of search is based on a 13 TeV proton-proton sample collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $36~fb^{-1}$. The results of the search are interpreted in several Simplified Models (SMS).}
